Lets you enable/disable/list your network interfaces as well as spoof
example for spoof
--------------------------------------------
> python network.py spoof [mac address here]
> [follow prompts]
> python network.py ["interface name here"] reset
--------------------------------------------
To reset to default mac
> python network.py spoof reset
> [follow prompts]
> python network.py ["interface name here"] reset
example for network interface manipulation
To list available interfaces:
--------------------------------------------
> python network.py list
--------------------------------------------
To turn off, on, reset interface
--------------------------------------------
> python network.py "[interface name here"] [on, off, reset]
